### Penguins

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin).

> Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds.  
> They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator.  
> Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers.  
> Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater.  
> They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.
